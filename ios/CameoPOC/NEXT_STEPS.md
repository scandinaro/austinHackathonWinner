# Ready to Build! Just Need to Fix Scheme in Xcode

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Everything is set up correctly:
- ‚úÖ App Clip target created: `com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip`
- ‚úÖ All Swift files in place
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated files deleted
- ‚úÖ Files moved to correct directory

## Issue

The scheme isn't configured to build for iOS Simulator. This is a 30-second fix in Xcode.

## Fix in Xcode (30 seconds)

I've opened the project for you. Now:

1. **At the top of Xcode**, click on the scheme dropdown (says "com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip")
2. Choose **"Edit Scheme..."**
3. In the left sidebar, select **"Build"**
4. Make sure under "Targets", the checkbox for **"com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip"** is checked for **all columns** (Run, Test, Profile, Analyze, Archive)
5. Click **"Close"**

## Then Build and Run

1. Select scheme: **com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip**
2. Select device: **iPhone 15 Pro** (or any simulator)
3. Click **Play** button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

## What You Should See

1. "Loading your Cameo..." - brief loading screen
2. Video starts playing automatically
3. No interruptions during playback
4. When video ends ‚Üí Beautiful post-video overlay
5. "POC MODE" badge in corner
6. "Download & Save Video" button (gradient)
7. "Watch Again" button

## Console Output to Watch For

```
App Clip invoked with Branch URL: ...
üé¨ POC: Loading sample video
üìä Analytics Event: video_viewed
üìä Analytics Event: video_loaded
üìä Analytics Event: video_completed
üéØ [POC] Download button tapped
```

## Quick Video for Testing

The default video is 10 minutes long. To test faster:

1. Open `com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip/VideoViewModel.swift`
2. Find line ~27: `let videoURLString = "..."`
3. Replace with:
```swift
let videoURLString = "https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerBlazes.mp4"
```
4. This is a 15-second video for quick testing

## If Scheme Fix Doesn't Work

Alternative: Create new scheme from scratch

1. Product menu ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Manage Schemes
2. Click "+" button
3. Select target: **com.cameo.CameoPOC.Clip**
4. Name it: **CameoAppClip**
5. Ensure "Shared" is checked
6. Click OK
7. Select this new scheme and build
